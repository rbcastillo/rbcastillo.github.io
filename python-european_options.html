                <h2>Challenge introduction</h2>

                <p>Pricing European options holds significant relevance in the field of finance, and acquiring the capability to perform these calculations through 
				both <strong>analytical formulas</strong> and <strong>Monte Carlo simulations</strong> in Python is a valuable skill set for those involved in 
				<strong>quantitative finance</strong> and algorithmic trading. These methods enable finance professionals and programmers to not only gain a <strong>deeper 
				understanding of option pricing models</strong> but also to develop practical and efficient tools.</p>
				
				<p>By implementing these pricing models in Python, one 
				can automate and streamline the process, making it easier to analyze various <strong>option strategies</strong>, perform <strong>risk assessments</strong>, 
				and adapt to <strong>dynamic market conditions</strong>. Moreover, this programming proficiency can be leveraged in developing custom financial software or 
				algorithmic trading systems, ultimately enhancing one's ability to make data-driven investment decisions and manage portfolios effectively in today's 
				fast-paced financial landscape.</p>
				
				<p>This challenge comes from my own experience in the field of <strong>quantitative finance</strong>. 
				I recommend attempting to solve the challenge independently before reviewing the provided solution.</p>

                <h2>Problem statement</h2>

                <p>European options are <strong>financial derivatives</strong> commonly traded in the stock and options markets. A European call option provides 
				the holder <strong>the right</strong>, but not the obligation, to <strong>buy an underlying asset</strong>, typically a stock, at a <strong>predetermined 
				strike price</strong> on a specified expiration date. On the other hand, a European put option gives the holder <strong>the right</strong>, but not the 
				obligation, to <strong>sell the underlying asset</strong> at the <strong>agreed-upon strike price</strong> upon the expiration date. These options differ 
				from American options in that they can only be exercised <strong>at expiration</strong>, while American options can be exercised at any time before or on 
				the expiration date.</p>
				
				<p>Upon reaching the expiration date, the profit outcomes for both call and put option buyers can be depicted as illustrated in the <strong>following 
				charts</strong>. When the market price of the underlying asset falls below (rises above) the predetermined strike price, the call (put) option buyer 
				incurs a <strong>limited loss</strong> equivalent to the premium paid to acquire the option. As the underlying asset's price surpasses the strike price, 
				the option's payoff <strong>becomes positive</strong>, and the breakeven point is achieved when the payoff equals the initial premium investment.</p>
				
				<a><img src="assets/img/european_call_put.png" style="width:max(min(70%, 700px), 300px);padding-top:1%;"></a>
				
				<p>Key pricing parameters for European options include the <strong>strike price</strong> (the price at which the asset will be bought or sold), the 
				<strong>current market price</strong> of the underlying asset, the <strong>time to expiration</strong>, the <strong>risk-free interest rate</strong>, 
				and <strong>volatility</strong>. These parameters are crucial in determining the option's market price, and mathematical models like the 
				<strong>Black-Scholes-Merton model</strong> are often used to calculate the fair value of European options.</p>
				
				<p>You have been provided with the task of obtaining the prices for a <strong>European call</strong> and a <strong>European put</strong> under the 
				Black-Scholes-Merton model by using two different approaches: <strong>analytical closed form</strong> and <strong>Monte Carlo simulation</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>

                <p>The Black-Scholes-Merton model, pioneered by economists Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in the early 1970s, laid the groundwork 
				for the development of <strong>rigorous mathematical models</strong> in the realm of <strong>derivative pricing</strong>.</p>
				
				<p>The model relies on a set of fundamental assumptions. Firstly, it assumes the <strong>efficiency of financial markets</strong>, characterized by 
				the <strong>absence of arbitrage opportunities</strong>. Second, it postulates that the underlying asset of the option follows a <strong>geometric Brownian 
				motion</strong>, capturing the continuous and stochastic nature of asset price fluctuations. The model further assumes the <strong>absence of transaction 
				costs</strong> and <strong>constant interest rates</strong>.</p>
				
				<p>A notable feature of the Black-Scholes-Merton model is that it intriguingly does not consider the expected returns of the underlying asset, as the 
				valuation approach seeks to create a <strong>hedged portfolio</strong> that remains immune to the stochastic evolution of the asset rather (while 
				<strong>considering its volatility</strong>). By ensuring that the option portfolio is effectively hedged, the invested amount is expected to increase 
				solely at the risk-free interest rate, which, therefore, serves as the relevant rate of return under the <strong>risk-neutral</strong> framework employed 
				by the model.</p> 
				
				<p>Ultimately, Black, Scholes, and Merton derived a system of <strong>differential equations</strong> governing the dynamics of option values, leading to 
				the following <strong>analytical expressions</strong> for pricing European call (\(\small C\)) and put (\(\small P\)) options.</p>
				
				<p>\(\small \displaystyle C = S e^{-q t}N(d_1) - K e^{-r t}N(d_2)\)</br>
				\(\small \displaystyle P = K e^{-r t}N(-d_2) - S e^{-q t}N(-d_1)\)</p>
				
				<p>With:</p>
				
				<p>\(\small \displaystyle d_1 = \frac{\ln{\frac{S}{K}} + (r - q + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}}\)</br>
				\(\small \displaystyle d_2 = \frac{\ln{\frac{S}{K}} + (r - q - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}} = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{t}\)</br>
				\(\small \displaystyle N(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{x} e^{-z^2/2}dz\) &emsp; (the CDF of the Gaussian distribution)</p>
				
				<p>Where:</p>
				
				<ul>				
					<li>\(\small S\) is the current price of the underlying.</li>
					<li>\(\small K\) is the strike price.</li>
					<li>\(\small r\) is the risk-free rate of return.</li>
					<li>\(\small t\) is the time to maturity for the option.</li>
					<li>\(\small \sigma\) is the volatility of the underlying.</li>
					<li>\(\small q\) is continuous rate of dividends of the underlying.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>One posible implementation of the analytical formula in Python is as follows:</p>

				<p>The alternative Monte Carlo simulation approach involves simulating the <strong>geometric Brownian motion</strong> that governs the <strong>behavior 
				of the underlying asset</strong> and then discounting the expected option payoff to its present value. The dynamics of the underlying asset price are 
				modeled using the following formula:</p>
				
				<p>\(\displaystyle S_t = S e^{(\mu - q - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma W_t}\)</p>
				
				<p>Here, \(\small W_t\) represents a Wiener process or <strong>standard Brownian motion</strong>, with the rest of the elements following the notation 
				previously described.</p>
				
				<p>After simulating a sufficient number of asset price paths up to the option's expiration at time \(\small T\), we can extract the vector of <strong>simulated 
				underlying prices</strong> at expiration (\(\small S_T\)). Therefore, the option's value at expiration is determined by the average of 
				\(\small max(S_T - K, 0)\) for call options and \(\small max(K - S_T, 0)\) for put options. To arrive at the present-day option price, the final step involves 
				<strong>discounting to present value</strong> using the factor \(\small e^{-rt}\).</p>

				<p>However, if our primary concern is solely the <strong>resulting option price</strong> without the need to consider other critical factors like option 
				sensitivities (the Greeks), we can develop a <strong>significantly faster</strong> and <strong>more robust</strong> simulation method based on the 
				properties of the geometric Brownian motion at the option's maturity.</p>
				
				<p>Upon closer examination of our geometric Brownian motion formula, we note a <strong>drift term</strong> that is time-dependent and a <strong>stochastic 
				term</strong> driven by a standard Brownian motion. For the drift term, we can conveniently replace the variables with their values at maturity, 
				substituting \(\small T\) instead of each intermediate \(\small t\), to determine the value at expiration. Regarding the Wiener process, <strong>we can 
				determine its mean (zero) and variance (\(\small T\))</strong> after \(\small T\) time steps, which is sufficient to characterize 
				its distribution of values. This simplification allows us to bypass intermediate steps and model the <strong>expected distribution of \(\small S_T\)</strong>, 
				following the previously described approach.</p>
				
				<p>This method converges <strong>much more rapidly</strong> as it requires the generation of significantly <strong>fewer random numbers</strong>. Additionally, 
				it is <strong>more precise</strong>, as it mitigates rounding errors and phenomena associated with the pseudo-random nature of numbers generated by 
				computer-based Monte Carlo simulations.</p>
